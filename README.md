# Nibble Kitchen

Nibble Kitchen is an e-commerce site offering various confections.

The site is fully responsive and was built using the Django framework in Python.

The live site has been deployed [here](https://nibble-kitchen.herokuapp.com/).

The payment system used for the site is called Stripe. The system is set up in a 'dummy' mode and will not accept real card details.

To test this functionality, please use the card details that can be [found here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-card-payments?platform=web&ui=elements#web-test-integration).
